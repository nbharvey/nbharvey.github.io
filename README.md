### 👋 Hi, I’m Naomi (nbharvey)

![Cartoon Naomi](assets/images/cartoon-naomi.png)

👀 I'm passionate about full-stack development, building creative and purposeful web apps from both the front and back ends.
- 🌱 Currently sharpening my frontend skills with React, Tailwind CSS, and Figma, while also learning backend fundamentals with Java, SQL, and Spring Boot. I'm growing as a developer through hands-on experience and mentorship with [LaunchCode](https://www.launchcode.org/).
- 🤝 I’m open to collaborating on beginner-friendly projects—especially those that align with education, wellness, or sustainability.
- 📫 You can reach me at **naomi.b.harvey@gmail.com** or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/naomi-harvey-masters-in-education-and-self-taught-software-developer).
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her  
- ⚡ Fun fact: I used to be an elementary school teacher!
    Now I'm channeling that energy into building engaging, inclusive, and curiosity-driven apps that help students learn.
    I’m also working on a personal project: a triathlon tracker app to support my training goals.
- 💕 Check out what I’m building at [Naomi's Portfolio] (https://naomicodes.netlify.app/)!
