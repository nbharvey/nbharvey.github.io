# 👋 Welcome — I'm Naomi Harvey!

I’m a software developer with a creative heart, a teacher’s mindset, and an adventurer’s spirit. After 6+ years in education, I transitioned into tech to build tools that empower people to learn, grow, and thrive.

I specialize in front-end development using **React**, **JavaScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Figma**, and I'm currently expanding my back-end skills with **Java**, **Spring Boot**, and **MySQL** through LaunchCode’s full-time software development program.

## 🧠 What I Do

- Build user-friendly web apps with modern tools and clean code
- Design intuitive interfaces that prioritize clarity and accessibility
- Adapt quickly to new tech, projects, and challenges
- Communicate clearly with technical and non-technical teams alike

## 🧗‍♀️ Outside the Code

My background in education drives my passion for **inclusive design**, and my love for **triathlons** and **mountain climbing** fuels my curiosity and discipline. Whether I’m sprinting up a trail or debugging an API, I love solving problems that push me to grow.

## 🛠️ What I’m Looking For

I'm seeking an **entry-level front-end or full-stack developer role** where I can contribute to mission-driven products in education, wellness, or sustainability. I thrive in collaborative environments and enjoy working on creative, beginner-friendly projects.
